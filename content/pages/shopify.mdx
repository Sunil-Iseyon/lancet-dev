Shopify helps businesses build, scale, and manage high-performance eCommerce stores with seamless user experiences and secure payment workflows. Global eCommerce sales reached **$6.4T in 2025** and are expected to keep growing in 2026, increasing pressure on brands to deliver fast and reliable online experiences ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/global-ecommerce-sales)). Lancet Software India delivers complete Shopify solutions for startups, growing brands, and enterprise merchants.

## Shopify Services

## Shopify Store Design & Development

Lancet Software India designs responsive Shopify stores that align with your brand identity. These stores optimize conversions through clear navigation and mobile-first layouts. Shopify supports millions of merchants across more than 175 countries, which reinforces the need for scalable design standards ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/in/partners/blog/shopify-stats)).

## Custom Shopify App Development

We build custom Shopify apps to extend store functionality and automate business processes. From inventory management and vendor workflows to custom checkout logic and third-party integrations, our engineering team delivers secure and maintainable app architectures. The Shopify App Store has grown to thousands of apps, showing the ecosystem demand for specialized capabilities ([Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/)).

## Payment Gateway & Checkout Integration

We integrate secure and scalable payment gateways, including Razorpay, Stripe, and PayPal, to improve checkout completion rates. Global digital payments are projected to grow steadily through 2028, making payment reliability a direct revenue lever ([Statista outlook](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-payments/worldwide)).

## Multi-Vendor & Marketplace Solutions

We help businesses build and manage multi-vendor marketplaces on Shopify. Our solutions support vendor onboarding, product ownership mapping, commission management, order tracking, and automated payouts while maintaining centralized control.

## Shopify Automation & Workflow Optimization

We streamline store operations using automation for order processing, inventory updates, refunds, cancellations, and vendor settlements. By reducing manual effort, we help teams scale efficiently and reduce operational errors.

## Shopify Integration Services

Our Shopify solutions integrate with ERP systems, CRM platforms, analytics tools, and third-party services. This creates near real-time synchronization across sales, inventory, finance, and customer engagement systems.

## Performance Optimization & Security

We optimize Shopify stores for speed, SEO, and reliability while implementing strong security practices. Performance is critical because even small latency increases can lower conversion in eCommerce journeys ([Google Web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/vitals)).

## Migration & Store Modernization

We migrate businesses from legacy platforms to Shopify with minimal downtime and controlled data validation. Migration coverage includes product data, customer records, order history, and payment configurations.

We provide continuous monitoring, enhancements, and support to keep Shopify stores secure and aligned with changing business requirements.
