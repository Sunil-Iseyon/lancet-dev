Shopify helps businesses build, scale, and manage high-performance eCommerce stores with streamlined user experiences and secure payment workflows. Global eCommerce sales reached **$6.4T in 2025** and are expected to keep growing in 2026, increasing pressure on brands to deliver fast and reliable online experiences ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/global-ecommerce-sales)). Lancet Software India delivers comprehensive Shopify solutions for startups, growing brands, and enterprise merchants.
