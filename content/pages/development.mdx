### Introducing Business As Usual Support (BAU)

Once your BI/DWH project moves to production and the development team has exhausted its budget, the project usually gets rolled to the business team to make any changes or enhancements. However, the business team has to depend on IT or full-time resources to make those changes. Full-time resources are busy and do not have available time for maintenance, new developments and other ad-hoc support needed.

### What is Lancet BAU?

Let Lancet provide 24×7 support under our BAU subscription. We provide the architect, developers and DBA’s needed to support your entire BI environment. Lancet has a wide range of skillsets in the Business Intelligence (BI) space and we will quickly become familiar with your environment. Our centralized team at Lancet India’s Bangalore facility takes advantage of knowledge sharing. All of our resources are trained in-house and certified in many different industry specific tools.

### How does Lancet BAU support work?

You can choose between a 6 month and 12 month subscription service. The service covers daily checks of your system, small bug fixes and minor enhancements. Based on the service agreement a portion of your unused hours can be used to do new development work. You can always add more hours (at a low yearly agreed upon rates) to your subscription within a few days notice.

### How does this help you?

Your full-time employees do not have to be involved in maintenance work and can focus on business-specific tasks. As soon as you sign up, Lancet will work 24×7, 365 days for you so that your employees can stay focused on more strategic initiatives or simply take a vacation.

### How is this different from other services?

There are shared services being provided by multiple vendors or available through other IT services. Although since BI is a niche area, nobody is providing Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the BI area, making Lancet BAU support the most cost effective option in market today.
