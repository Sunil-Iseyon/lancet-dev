Enterprises that adopt modern analytics practices are more likely to outperform peers on decision speed and operational agility ([McKinsey insights](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)). Lancet Software India helps organizations implement Strategy (MicroStrategy) solutions that can typically convert raw data into governed and actionable intelligence, depending on data readiness and user adoption.

## Strategy Consulting Coverage

**What is MicroStrategy?** MicroStrategy (Strategy) is an enterprise business intelligence platform that transforms raw data into governed dashboards, reports, and mobile analytics. It supports large-scale data analysis for decision support.

## Enterprise BI Strategy & Roadmap

Lancet Software India defines a practical business intelligence roadmap aligned to the client operating model, data sources, and governance priorities. The team typically translates enterprise goals into a phased implementation plan for Strategy. This involves assessing current data maturity, identifying high-value use cases, mapping data source dependencies, and defining governance milestones. The resulting roadmap typically spans 6–18 months and includes clear deliverables at each phase.

## Platform Administration & Security

Lancet Software India configures environments, establishes user roles, connects data warehouses, and implements security controls for reliable enterprise use. The administration framework covers access control policies, audit logging, performance monitoring, and automated environment provisioning. These controls ensure that enterprise data remains protected while enabling self-service analytics for authorized users.

## Development & Customization

Lancet Software India builds dashboards, semantic models, and custom workflows tailored to business KPIs. The team also adapts Strategy components to fit domain-specific reporting requirements. Development follows repeatable patterns that include design reviews, performance testing, and user acceptance validation. This structured approach ensures that custom implementations remain maintainable and aligned with enterprise standards.

## Migration & Optimization

Lancet Software India migrates reports and metadata from legacy BI systems into Strategy while improving query performance and refresh reliability. This approach reduces disruption during platform transition. The migration process includes compatibility assessment, automated script conversion, side-by-side validation testing, and phased cutover planning to minimize risk and downtime.

## Managed Support

The Lancet support model includes proactive health checks, issue triage, and continuous optimization intended to maintain uptime and trust in analytics delivery. Actual uptime improvements depend on environment complexity and infrastructure maturity.

## Strategy Mobile

Strategy mobile capabilities help users access governed analytics on phones and tablets, enabling faster field decisions and executive visibility.

## Proprietary Delivery Benchmarks

| Service Area | Lancet Outcome Metric | Methodology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BI Roadmapping | Up to 28% faster rollout planning cycles | Stakeholder workshops and dependency mapping |
| Report Migration | Up to 35% reduction in cutover rework | Validation scripts and reconciliation checkpoints |
| Performance Tuning | Up to 30% faster critical dashboard load times | Baseline and post-tuning query benchmarking |
| Managed Operations | Higher SLA compliance through continuous monitoring | Weekly service reviews and issue pattern analysis |

**Considerations and Limitations:** MicroStrategy implementation outcomes vary based on factors such as data warehouse maturity, user training, and existing IT infrastructure. Organizations with limited analytics experience may need additional onboarding and change management support. The benchmarks above reflect observed outcomes across multiple engagements and may not be representative of every deployment.
